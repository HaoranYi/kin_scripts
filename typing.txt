# Typing Exercise with Emacs

This document is for my typing experiment with emacs.

## How can I do spell check in emacs?
Enable fly-spell minor mode (require install ispell, i.e. 'brew
install ispell'.  There are also flyspell commands associated, such as
move to next error, correct misspell word.


## How to get help in emacs?
Use emacs built in help commands to find out what's going on.
'C-h C-h' to learn.


## How to fix the color of emacs on Mac terminal?
The white background highlight make the text, which is also white very hard to see.


## How to increase font size?
It doesn't work in terminal.


## Move by sentence, paragraph is very useful in emacs.


In the end, using emacs in Mac terminal is not very good.  I have tried to love
and work in emacs serval times.  But each time, it turns out that I can't love
it.  There are always something that make emacs not as good to use as vim or
other editors.  In terms of efficient key binding, it is not as good as vim.
In terms of function of full IDE, it is not as good as vscode or clion.  If
I just want to use a lightweigh edtior, I will go to vim.  If I want a full
IDE, I will go to vscode or clion.  Emacs is sort of in the middle.  To get it
working, you need to spend a lot of time to configure it.  Not worth it if you
can do it almost free and better with the other editor. 

=======================================================================
Vim is a much better choice to use inside terminal. 

## How to get help of vim?
