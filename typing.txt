# Typing Exercise with Emacs

This document is for my typing experiment with emacs.

## How can I do spell check in emacs?
Enable fly-spell minor mode (require install ispell, i.e. 'brew
install ispell'.  There are also flyspell commands associated, such as
move to next error, correct misspell word.


## How to get help in emacs?
Use emacs built in help commands to find out what's going on.
'C-h C-h' to learn.


## How to fix the color of emacs on Mac terminal?
The white background highlight make the text, which is also white very hard to see.


## How to increase font size?
It doesn't work in terminal.


## Move by sentence, paragraph is very useful in emacs.


In the end, using emacs in Mac terminal is not very good. 

=======================================================================
Vim is a much better choice to use inside terminal.
