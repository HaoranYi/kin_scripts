# Rents 

Rents are collected from accounts which didn't meet minimal rent exempt
balance. Collected rents are distributed to staked validators. 

Account has a field called rent_epoch to decide when rent is due. Since this
field need to be updated per epoch, it is a performance bottleneck. 

Spread rent collection throughout the epoch. Each block is scanning a range of
the pubkeys. When a block freeze, it collect rents for its partition.

block freeze also collect_fees, distribute rents, update slot_history sysvar,
and run incinerator to burn extra lamport.

rent_Rewrite??

historically, even for rent_exempted accounts we still rewrite it -- i.e.
updating its rent_epoch. 

However, if the balance of the account doesn't change, we don't need to udpate
the account? setting rent_epoch to max for rent_exempted accounts. Then no
changes. -- skip_rewrite

enforce that no new rent exempted accounts can be created. rent paying concept
will die.

For each changed account, we need to compute its hash.

In summary, a historical design. Not very useful.
