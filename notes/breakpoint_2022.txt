NFT mint fee (cheap)
    - 1M NFTs = 5sol
    - NFT is becoming as cheap a transaction
    - scale to 1 billion
    - compressed NFT (stored into the ledger)
    - parsed and cached in the indexer (dApps and client interacts with indexer to get the data)
    - data is stored off-chain. only store merkle tree hash on chain.
        - create new leaf data
        - log new data
        - update data 
    - metaplex: serve the merkle proof
        - merkle tree: binary hash tree
        root -- n -- n -- n 
             \        \
              \        n
                n -- n
                 \
                  n
        on chain only store the root. transaction only takes the root hash.
        given the root hash, serve the data. verify the data using merkle tree for the root hash
        
token
    - a set of rules encoded in the smart contract
    - an example of token is to have a pool of sols and give out token for representing the shares of the pool
    - token can be redeem to sol in the pool
    - NFT is a token. unique identifier for art. content is the hash. then you can mint to get id for the art (token).
        - this token can be transferred in exchange for sol
        
hxro
    - crypto options   
        - exotic options: touch price bet, end price bet, pool bat 
        - clearing and settlement
        - record the transactions as smart contract on chain
        
texture finance (sol strategy)
    - borrow token and stake them to ear rewards
    - use leverage
        - let's say normal stake rewards is 7%
        - leverage ratio is 3x borrow is 5%
        - then your return is 21% - 10% = 11%
        - add options in the portfolio to balance the risk 
        - automatically collect rewards and delegate them 
    - manage risk and select validator with best rewards (i.e. jito)

legal consideration for token company
    - bottom line: focus on technology, not on selling the tokens
    
vc in bear market
    - due intelligence
    - background check for the founder

fire-dancer
    - fpga for network packet processing at line rate
    - locality optimization
    - price == consensus discovery
    - modelling and speed

wallet
  - identity (pk, prk), used to sign and authroize transactions
  - phantom/solflare are the solana wallets
token account
  - accounts that holding different tokens (associated with the main wallet
    account)
  - have the owner as the wallet account (derived accounts)
  - people can create their own tokens and give tokens to others (in their
    token account)
  - people with token accounts and sell tokens and get sol if they want
nft
  - yet another kind of token
  - can transfered, and converted to sol
