This is going to be my writing and work journal. Each day I learn something new, I will write it down. 
VScode is going to be my main coding environment. I will spend more time on reading code and writing code 
in this environment. This environment has a very good code completion and code browsing function.
I will need to get used to it and be familiar with the key board shortcuts in it.

The important ones are how to move around efficiently. 
cmd+enter         open a new line   
cmd+shift+enter   open a new line above 
cmd+shift+K       delete a line 
C+K               delete a line to the left
Opt+arrow         to move by words

Efficiently moving around and editing the code is the key. learn to move around with arrow and fn + Opt keys. 
cmd + up/down     go to beginning and end of the document
cmd + \           split editor
cmd + 1,2         focus on split window
cmd + p           select file

ctrl -            navigate back 
ctrl shift -      navigate forward

selection
Shift+Alt+arrow   selection by word
Shift+cmd+arrow   selection by line
cmd+L             selection by line
Ctrl+shift+left/right   smart selection by line

Learn to use vscode shortcuts and vscode commands when working in vscode. Don't be afraid 
to code in vscode. And most of the coding exercise is to move around, copying and editing 
code. learn to do it and learn to master it. take time to practice. For the benefit, I can 
also use vim to edit the code. if that's more efficient and use vscode to browse and debug 
code. Be versatile. Don't be too rigid. Use what best suitable to work on the task at hand.
Take time to slow down and pause when coding.

Remember to read the code and read the docs for the code. 

Move by line, move by word, move by search.
Move to the beginning/end of line
Move to the beginning/end of the document.

Select lines and continue to select regions.

The office is really nice. First time, in the office, that I can picked a seat that facing the windows, and have a good view to outside. 
The clear blue sky and the high buildings. The whole environment is very good. Not many people are around in the building.
Standing up desk. Big space and large window. Be positive and keep looking out for good things. Keep trying and keep exploring. 
Life is an experience. Learn to live at the present moment, appreciate the things now.
